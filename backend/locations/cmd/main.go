	// Create a context with cancellation capabilities to manage the lifecycle of the application.
	// 'context.Background()' returns a non-nil, empty context. It is never canceled, has no values, and has no deadline.

	// 'defer' is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a programâ€™s execution, usually for purposes of cleanup.
	// 'cancel' is a function that, when called, will signal to the context that it should be canceled.
	// 'defer cancel()' ensures that the 'cancel' function is called when the current function returns, which is 'main' in this case.
	// This is important for resource cleanup and to signal any goroutines running in parallel to stop execution.
	defer cancel()

	// This pattern is common in Go for handling graceful shutdowns.
	// By calling 'cancel', all operations or goroutines that are using 'ctx' will receive a cancellation signal.
	// They can listen for this signal by checking the 'Done' channel on the 'ctx' object and perform any necessary cleanup operations before terminating.
	// This allows the application to shut down gracefully and avoid leaving resources in an inconsistent state.
